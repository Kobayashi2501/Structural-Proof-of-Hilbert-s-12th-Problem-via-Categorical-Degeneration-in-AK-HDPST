# 🌐 Structural Proof of Hilbert's 12th Problem   via Categorical Degeneration in AK-HDPST

This repository presents a **structural, category-theoretic solution** to **Hilbert’s 12th Problem**, constructed through  
the framework of **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**.

---

### 📌 Overview

Hilbert’s 12th problem demands an explicit construction of the maximal abelian extension \( K^{\text{ab}} \) of a number field \( K \) using special functions.  
Although solutions for \( \mathbb{Q} \) and imaginary quadratic fields exist via modular and elliptic functions, the general real quadratic case has remained open.

> **This project demonstrates a constructive and categorical resolution** for both imaginary and real quadratic cases using tools from topology, derived categories, and degeneration theory.

### ✅ Key Results

- ✅ **Imaginary quadratic case**:  
  Persistent homology decay + Ext\(^1\) vanishing leads to \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})^{\text{ab}} \) construction via AK-sheaf colimit

- ✅ **Real quadratic case**:  
  Special functions are not required; categorical Ext-collapse ensures abelianization structure internally

- ✅ **Special functions are internally realized**:  
  AK-tropical functions \( \theta_n^{\text{trop}} \) mimic modular behavior without explicit analytic construction

### 🔍 Proof Sketch

1. Define AK-sheaf from units in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\pm d}) \)
2. Track degeneration via persistent homology \( \mathrm{PH}_1 \to 0 \)
3. Show Ext\(^1(F_t, -) \to 0 \) in derived AK-category
4. Conclude that the colimit \( F_\infty \cong K^{\text{ab}} \)
